# Running Santa
This is a Christmas-themed game in python using the module [pygame](http://www.pygame.org/). In the game, we have a little Santa Claus running down the screen. You can <kbd>↑</kbd> and <kbd>↓</kbd> key to make him be able to jump up and slide down.
There are obstacles appearing on the way and the Santa has to either jump over or duck under the obstacles to survive. It continually gets faster, so as the time progresses it gets faster and therefore it gets more difficult to react.
If the Santa hit an obstacle, the game is over, and then the previous score and the score this time will be shown on the end screen.
